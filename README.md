# myHome
myHome is a personal project that I started developing a few months ago. Initially, it was a simple project designed to refresh my knowledge of PHP, as I was studying it at school. This repository contains the PHP version, which I currently use locally at home. On myHome, you can reserve rooms in your house, add items to the shopping list, ask for favors, and do many other things..

# Technologies Used
Web version: PHP (running on XAMPP)
DataBase: mySql
Server: xampp
# Purpose
This project serves as both a personal home management tool and a learning exercise, helping me improve my skills in web development.
