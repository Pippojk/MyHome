# myHome
My Home is an idea that i started developing some month ago, initally it was a simple project to remember php couse i was goinmg to doit at school, in fact this is the php version, which i use in my home with xampp, i started developing an app in react native of myHome since i thinked that would be better than a website, it's my first app and i'm using react native couse i already know react.
